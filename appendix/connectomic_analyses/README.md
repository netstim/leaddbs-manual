# Connectomics

LEAD-DBS Connectome supports connectomic analyses based on

* [functional magnetic resonance imaging \(fMRI\)](https://leaddbs.gitbooks.io/leaddbs-manual/content/fmri_analysis.html) data acquired at rest \(rs-fMRI\). This metric is used to analyze functional interactions \("functional connectivity"\) in the brain.
* [diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging \(dMRI\)](https://leaddbs.gitbooks.io/leaddbs-manual/content/dmri_dti_analysis.html), commonly referred to as "DTI". This metric is commonly used to analyze structural connectivity in the brain.
