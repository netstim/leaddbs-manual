    - `Preferences > Edit Preferences File...`

### Load MER Localizer
Clicking the MER icon in the 3D viewer toolbar will give you a reconstruction of the MER locations based on the lead localization, and a new MER Control GUI.

1. Choose the implanted tract from the dropdown menu near `Right` or `Left`

2. Toggle the implanted tracks on and off `Central, Anterior, Posterior, Lateral, Medial`.

3. Change the location of the MER site by:
  
    - Entering the position in the edit box
    
    OR
    - Using the arrow keys to change the position along the track
       - Hold `Shift` to increase step size. 
       - Hold `option` to decrease step size.
              - note: Choose a toggle button for the electrode of interest. 
      
4. Mark a recording site using keyboard shortcuts. Reserved keys:
    - `spacebar = "generic"`
    - `m = "MER"`
    - `l = "LFP"`
    - `t = "Top"`
    - `b = "Bottom"`

5. Use the `export markers` <img src="https://github.com/leaddbs/leaddbs/blob/master/icons/export.png" height="18" width="18" /> button in the MER Control GUI to save markers as a `.mat` file.
