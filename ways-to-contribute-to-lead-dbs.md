# How to contribute to Lead-DBS

We are grateful for any help in developing Lead-DBS. We have been coordinating the development on Slack, so get in touch with us to get an invite and join our monthly developer meetings. You are also welcome to clone or fork Lead-DBS from [Github](https://github.com/netstim/leaddbs) and submit pull requests.&#x20;

You can also contribute to Lead-DBS with other things than code. For instance, maintaining this user guide or answering user questions on our help channels (the forum and the user Slack channel) is a great way to help and give back to the community. In addition, sharing data such as atlases, connectomes or clinical scores associated with VTAs are greatly appreciated.
