# Introduction

Lead-DBS is an open-source, MATLAB-based toolbox to **localize** and **visualize** electrodes in patients treated with deep brain stimulation. Importantly, the toolbox is intended for research and not for clinical use. First, this user guide focuses on Lead-DBS and single patient analysis with co-registration, normalization and reconstruction. Second, the user guide covers group analyses with Lead-Group.

This user guide is intended to cover most use cases. It pairs well with the primer for [postoperative CT data](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page\_id=220) or [postoperative MR data](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page\_id=225). It also goes well with the [basic walkthrough video](https://www.lead-dbs.org/helpsupport/knowledge-base/walkthrough-videos/) and a [more recent walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/xobhQDgtVfs) (Lead-DBS v2.5 new tools). For troubleshooting or other questions, the Lead-DBS community offers great support on the [Slack user channel](https://www.lead-dbs.org/helpsupport/slack-user-channel/).

**Quick history:** Lead-DBS was initially developed at the [Movement Disorders Unit of Andrea Kühn](http://www.neuromodulation.berlin), Department of Neurology, Charité – University Medicine (CCM), Berlin, Germany. Since 2019, the [Network Stimulation Laboratory of Andreas Horn ](http://www.netstim.berlin)has been coordinating the development.

## Key Features

* Linear and nonlinear normalization of MRI and CT images to MNI space
* Reconstruction of the electrode trajectories
* Manual correction of the electrode localization
* Visualization of results in 2D slice views
* Visualization of a 3D model showing DBS electrodes and their target areas
* Calculation of the Volume of Activated Tissue (VAT) and visualization of the structural connectivity from the VAT to other brain areas
