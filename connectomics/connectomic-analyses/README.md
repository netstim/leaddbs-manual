# Connectomics

LEAD-DBS Connectome supports connectomic analyses based on

* [functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)](https://leaddbs.gitbooks.io/leaddbs-manual/content/fmri\_analysis.html) data acquired at rest (rs-fMRI). This metric is used to analyze functional interactions ("functional connectivity") in the brain.
* [diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)](https://leaddbs.gitbooks.io/leaddbs-manual/content/dmri\_dti\_analysis.html), commonly referred to as "DTI". This metric is commonly used to analyze structural connectivity in the brain.
