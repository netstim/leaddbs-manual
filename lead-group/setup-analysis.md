**1)** Specify your directory by clicking "Choose Dataset Directory." This should be the folder that contains your derivatives, source and raw folders. (fig. 1)

**2)** Name your group analysis in the window that pops up. (fig. 1) This process creates a .mat file inside your derivatives/leadgroup/groupanalysisID folder that will store the group information including the stimulation parameters and regressors. (fig. 2)
