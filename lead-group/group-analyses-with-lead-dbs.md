# Group analyses with Lead-DBS

{% hint style="info" %}
Lead group is best documented by [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.904615v1) and the accompanying walkthrough tutorial found on [OSF](https://osf.io/kj456/).

An older resource are [these walkthrough slides](https://www.lead-dbs.org/docs/tutorials/group\_analyses\_horn.pdf)
{% endhint %}

Once the coregistration, normalization and reconstruction steps have been performed for a group of patients, you can load these in the group GUI, which you can start by entering

`lead group`

into the MATLAB command line.

From here, several options for visualization and analysis of clinical/multimodal data are available. The rest of this section explains how to [setup-analysis.md](setup-analysis.md "mention"), how to create [group-visualization.md](group-visualization.md "mention")s and how to [calculate-vta-and-stats.md](calculate-vta-and-stats.md "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
Before starting, please make sure to check accuracy of both normalization and reconstruction for each patient you analyse.
