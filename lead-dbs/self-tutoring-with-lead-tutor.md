# Self-Tutoring with Lead-Tutor

With the publication of Lead Tutor, we came up with a package that is ideal for self-tutoring Lead-DBS based electrode localizations, which includes

* A [scientific paper](https://apertureneuro.org/article/129658-lead-tutor-an-open-access-educational-resource-for-deep-brain-stimulation-electrode-localizations) summarizing the effort
* A [dataset](https://osf.io/jxecg/?view_only=f2765a6aa3604dea8afa14365b70381c) of anonymized imaging data from ten DBS patients
* A tool (integrated into Lead-DBS) that you can used to check your results

Get started by downloading the dataset and paper (links above). Load up the dataset in Lead-DBS and start localizing.
