# Reconstruction File

The data is stored

* for BIDS version, under: derivatives/leaddbs/patientID/reconstructions/sub-patientID\_desc-reconstruction.mat&#x20;
* for classic version under the `ea_reconstruction.mat` file inside the patient directory.

There is a single variable `reco`.&#x20;

`reco.native` stores reconstruction in native postoperative space, `reco.scrf` is after subcortical refine (brainshift correction - if it was applied) and `reco.mni` stores the reconstruction in the mni space. &#x20;

`reco.native.coord`s stores the coordinates for electrode contacts. For instance, `reco.native.coords_mm{2}(3,:)` is the left (`{2}`) third lowest (`(3,:)`) contact coordinates in x, y, z in native postoperative space.&#x20;

The indexing of the contacts usually follow **the same order as defined by lead manufacture,** starting from the bottom. **For segmented contacts**, different manufacturers may have different order definition. For example, at level 2 of the directed electrode from Boston Scientific(Fig. 1), the order is 2 -> 3 -> 4 (counter-clock wise seen from top). But for Abbott, itâ€™s 1A -> 1B -> 1C (clock wise seen from top)(Fig.2)
